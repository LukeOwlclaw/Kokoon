# Inofficial bug tracking for Kokoon App (https://kokoon.io/)

I am experiencing many bugs with the Kokoon App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kokoon.krelax&hl=en_US). Unfortunately, they do not have an open bug tracking tool. You'll need to send emails to their support address. They'll answer swiftly but it makes progress checking for users difficult/impossible.

So I invite all Kokoon users to share their bug reports here (**which they still need to send to the support address**).
